title: "Text Analysis & Text Mining"
---

Text analysis and text mining are not terribly novel. In fact, the indexing--with keywords and controlled vocabularies--cataloguing, and abstracting of texts are all examples of the results of text analysis and text mining; and are all early examples of providing access to increasingly large quantities of published materials. These particular products are designed to aid in information retrieval; extracting key pieces of information to aid in the discovery of a work to answer a question. At the same time, activities related to information extraction--analysis of a text to uncover things like trends, connections etc--have perhaps always been integral to texts and are evident in things like markup, marginalia--which are embedded in the original text--and interpretations--that are independent of the original text.

It's interesting to note that many of these activities--keyword extraction, abstract creation, markup etc--are early approaches to the creation of structured records of otherwise unstructured documents and their early manifestations are the analogue equivalent to many of the concepts covered in the session on [markup languages and Markdown](https://vdunbar.github.io/markup-markdown/).

Deeper reading and manual processing of texts continue to have purpose and allow for specific knowledge or data generating activities. However, computationally aided approaches are increasingly relied upon to support specific types of inquiry--information extraction--or information retrieval. These computational approaches are of particular benefit when the amount of text to be analyzed or mined exceeds what can reasonably done by a close reading. And a wealth of tools have been developed to aid researchers and the otherwise curious to engage in these computational approaches. Picking the right computational approach will depend on the task or research question that is being addressed. And some of these tools are designed to complement or assist a human guided approach, while others are designed around algorithms that themselves are designed to either facilitate retrieval or provide derived information.

### Know your dataset

Before selecting a relevant tool for analysis, it's important to know that data you're going to be working with. While the process of inquiry generally is about taking a deeper dive into knowing your data, some of the first things we need to consider are the size or extent of the dataset, the format of the dataset--and this may refer to either its encoding or its genre--and importantly if there are any restrictions--privacy and sensitivity--to be taken into account.
